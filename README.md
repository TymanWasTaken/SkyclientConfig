# SkyclientConfig

Why are there no libs you may ask, and why does the mod not compile? This is because I didn't want to reupload all the mods that this supports. Here is an updated list of them you can download and put in the libs folder.
- Modcore (see below)
- [Patcher](https://sk1er.club/mods/patcher)
- More soontm

### Modcore

Modcore is not a normal mod so there isn't a public page for it. You can however download it from `https://static.sk1er.club/repo/mods/modcore/{modcorever}/{mcver}/ModCore-{modcorever}%20({mcver}).jar`. For example, https://static.sk1er.club/repo/mods/modcore/0.1.47/1.8.9/ModCore-0.1.47%20(1.8.9).jar
Modcore is not actually a mod used in the config of this, it is just included for the libraries it contains, like vigilance.

## Update
I added a setup script to download the libs for you, just run `./setup` (for most shells) or `setup` (for cmd)
